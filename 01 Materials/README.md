# Materials

## 1 Base Color
Define the diffuse color of the surface

Real-world materials are not darker than 20 and not brighter than 240

Use real-world measurements or capatured data for best results

## 2 Metalic
### Non-metalic

### Metalic

## 3 Specular
Non-metal material surfaces reflect about 4% of light

0.5 represents 4% reflection

## 4 Roughness
Represent the roughness of the surface at a microscopic scale

## 5 Emissive Color

## 6 Normal
Defines the shape of the surface

Each pixel represents a vector that indicates the direction that the surface is facing

## 7 Ambient Occlusion
Only effective when the global illumination is activated

## 8 Float
### One float
for the channel that needs single value: metalic, specular and roughness

### Two float
Store UV

### Three float
Store RGB

### Four float
Store RGB Î±
